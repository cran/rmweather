# rmweather 0.1.4

  - Replace deprecated `data_frame` with `tibble`
  
  - Replace deprecated `funs` with `~`
  
  - Allow `rmw_plot_test_prediction` to not fix axes, useful for facetting after the plot has been generated
  
  - Minor logic change to `rmw_predict` to handle tibble's non-dropping behaviour

# rmweather 0.1.3

  - Example data are now tibbles, not data frames

  - Add citation file with two publications

# rmweather 0.1.2

  - Add tolerance to an R^2 unit test for some flavours of Linux used on the CRAN networks

  - The enhancement of a number of functions to allow for the estimation of uncertainty/errors of predictions
  
  - Convenient plotting functions now have colour arguments
  
  - Normalised predictions can now be returned without being aggregated
  
  - Add `na.rm` argument to data preparing function to avoid imputing of the dependent variable
  
  - Add `replace` argument to data preparing function so generated variables replace existing variables of the same name if they exist
  
  - Add `variables_sample` argument to `rmw_do_all` to allow for a user to choose which variables to be sampled for the normalisation step
